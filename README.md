## Hello, I'm Thiago Santos :)

  In 2017, I had my first contacts with Linux, an operating system that I still find super interesting, and occasionally, my introduction to the world of intro. My passion for programming started in 2018, when I had my first experience with coding. I found it so amazing that further down the language would become a web developer, deciding to study Html in the week and later in JavaScript, and taking some programming languages â€‹ that I actually learned. After that, my first experience in a 6 month internship, which was a vacancy of Analyst and Systems Developer, I was able to learn the SQL language and did project tasks for the MySQL Database, which was developed in Data Management systems. bank companies, which is on my GiHub as REGISTER in Python. I'm currently delving into Front end and the React.Js tool.

Feel free to contact me ðŸ™‚
